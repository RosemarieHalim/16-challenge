        Hi there! I am Graphic Designer that dabbles in web development
        from Windsor, Ontario. I believe in strong team work to create 
        an experience for clients by creating new and unique graphic 
        solutions. I enjoy all parts of the creative process and learning 
        new skills. I'm not afraid to take initiative and take on new 
        challenges to improve myself. My goal is to have fun and spread 
        new ideas and perspectives around our community.
